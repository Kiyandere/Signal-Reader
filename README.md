# Signal-Reader
This software will essentially read the most recent exported .csv data output from TinySA-App.exe, extract the highest dB along with its frequency and display it.
Afterwards the .csv file is moved to old_csv folder to be stored. You can choose to delete its contents if you wish.
Make sure to save the expoerted .csv file to the same folder as the signal-ready.py as it reads the local folder.


## TODO
- [ ] Compare frequency and decibel with SWR-Bridge's data in order to send data to RT21 to rotate the antenna towards the best position.
